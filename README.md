# TIFX04-LEMA-DataProcessing
Data processing for our Bachelor thesis in applied physics (TIFX04-22-82) where we built and optimized a linear electromagnetic accelerator (LEMA).

Data processing:

-Read CSV

-Calculate numerical derivative to get speed from position

-Apply gaussian filter for noise reduction

-Write to CSV with a few tweaks to the data


NOTE TO SELF:
TODO: write how to use the program, in what order, what everything is and so on!
