# TIFX04-LEMA-DataProcessing
Data processing for our Bachelor thesis in applied physics (TIFX04-22-82) where we built and optimized a linear electromagnetic accelerator (LEMA).

Data processing:

-Read CSV

-Calculate numerical derivative to get speed from position

-Apply gaussian filter for noise reduction

-Write to CSV with a few tweaks to the data



notes:
need to fill in 
'filename_rawCSV' and 'filename_processedCSV' manually for now //2022-04-24
